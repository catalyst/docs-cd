docs-cd:
  # The home parameter defines where docs-cd will store all documentation
  # artifacts it produces.
  home: /home/ubuntu
  # Apache www home, so that built documents can be stored in there.
  www-home: /var/www
  # The versions parameter defines how many versions of the documentation
  # docs-cd will preserve under PROJECT_PATH/html/commit_id. Note that a new
  # version is generated with every new commit (change) followed by the
  # of docs-cd. If you update your documentation and run docs-cd very frequently
  # this number could be high and you may want to increase it.
